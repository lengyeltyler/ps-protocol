# p.s. Protocol: Privacy-Preserving Multi-Chain Identity Management
## A ZK-Powered Approach to Web3 Asset Discovery and Identity Abstraction

**Version 1.0**  
**Date: August 2025**

---

## Abstract

The p.s. Protocol introduces a novel approach to Web3 identity management that preserves user privacy while enabling seamless multi-chain asset discovery and interaction. By creating separate identity layers on top of existing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), users can maintain multiple personas for different Web3 activities without exposing their primary wallet address. The protocol combines NFT-based identity representation with community-verified contract registries and zero-knowledge asset discovery to create a unified, privacy-first Web3 experience.

**Key Innovations:**
- **Identity NFTs**: Each user identity is represented by an NFT that controls a dedicated smart contract
- **ZK Asset Discovery**: Privacy-preserving discovery of user assets across verified protocols
- **Community Contract Verification**: Decentralized system for verifying legitimate smart contracts
- **Multi-Persona Management**: Users can maintain separate identities for different Web3 activities

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Current State of Web3 Identity

Web3 users today face significant privacy and usability challenges when interacting with decentralized applications. Every interaction requires connecting their primary wallet address, creating a permanent and public record of all activities. This approach has several fundamental issues:

- **Privacy Erosion**: All activities are linked to a single, publicly visible address
- **Identity Fragmentation**: Users must manually connect to each new protocol
- **Asset Invisibility**: No unified view of assets across different protocols
- **Security Risks**: High-value addresses become targets for attacks

### 1.2 Vision for p.s. Protocol

The p.s. Protocol envisions a Web3 ecosystem where users maintain complete control over their privacy and identity presentation. Users can create multiple identities for different purposes—trading, gaming, art collection—while keeping their primary wallet address completely private. Each identity operates as an independent smart contract, providing both privacy and programmability.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Privacy and Identity Challenges

**Lack of Identity Separation**
Current Web3 infrastructure forces users to use the same address across all applications, making it impossible to maintain separate personas for different activities. A user cannot simultaneously be an anonymous DeFi trader and a public NFT collector without revealing the connection.

**No Asset Discovery Mechanism**
Users have no way to discover which protocols they have assets in without manually checking each one. This creates friction when trying to manage portfolios across multiple chains and protocols.

**Complex Multi-Chain Management**
Managing assets across different blockchains requires switching networks, managing multiple gas tokens, and understanding each chain's specific requirements.

### 2.2 Technical Limitations

**EOA Constraints**
Externally Owned Accounts lack programmability, making it impossible to implement features like spending limits, automated transactions, or delegated control without compromising security.

**Verification Challenges**
Users have no reliable way to verify which smart contracts are legitimate, leading to frequent interactions with malicious contracts.

**Integration Friction**
Each dApp must implement wallet connection functionality independently, leading to inconsistent user experiences and repeated authorization flows.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 System Overview

The p.s. Protocol consists of four core components that work together to provide privacy-preserving identity management:

1. **Identity NFT System**: Creates and manages user identities
2. **Smart Contract Registry**: Community-verified database of legitimate contracts
3. **ZK Asset Discovery**: Privacy-preserving asset scanning system
4. **Cross-Chain Execution Layer**: Unified interface for multi-chain operations

### 3.2 Identity NFT System

#### Core Concept
Each p.s. identity is represented by a unique NFT minted to the user's primary EOA. This NFT controls a dedicated smart contract that serves as the operational address for that identity. Users can create multiple identities, each with its own NFT and smart contract.

#### Identity Creation Process
1. User connects their existing wallet to the p.s. Protocol
2. User generates a new key pair specific to the p.s. identity
3. Protocol mints an NFT representing this identity to user's EOA
4. A smart contract is deployed specifically for this identity
5. The smart contract is linked to both the NFT and the p.s. key pair

#### Authorization Model
Operations require dual authorization:
- **p.s. Key Signature**: Proves control of the specific identity
- **EOA Authorization**: Confirms the primary wallet approves the action

This ensures that while identities operate independently, the user's primary wallet maintains ultimate control.

### 3.3 Community-Verified Contract Registry

#### Verification System
The protocol maintains a decentralized registry of verified smart contracts. Community members can submit contracts for verification, and the community votes on legitimacy based on factors such as:
- Security audit results
- Code quality and transparency
- Community reputation
- Total value locked and usage statistics

#### Registry Structure
Each verified contract entry contains:
- Contract address and deployment chain
- Protocol category (DEX, lending, NFT marketplace, etc.)
- Verification score from community voting
- Metadata including ABI and documentation links
- Integration status with p.s. Protocol

#### Self-Sustaining Verification
The registry operates without central control. Verification power is distributed among community members based on their reputation and stake in the ecosystem. Contracts automatically become active once they reach sufficient verification scores.

### 3.4 ZK-Powered Asset Discovery

#### Privacy-Preserving Scanning
The asset discovery system can identify which verified protocols contain user assets without revealing wallet addresses or specific holdings. This is achieved through zero-knowledge proofs that verify asset ownership without exposing sensitive information.

#### Discovery Process
1. User initiates asset scan from their primary EOA
2. System checks all verified contracts for potential asset holdings
3. ZK proofs are generated for each protocol where assets are found
4. User receives a privacy-preserving report of discovered assets
5. User can choose which assets to link to which identities

#### Selective Disclosure
Users maintain complete control over what information is revealed. They can choose to:
- Show only protocol names without amounts
- Reveal specific holdings to certain identities
- Keep all asset information completely private

### 3.5 Cross-Chain Execution

#### Unified Interface
The protocol provides a single interface for operations across multiple blockchains. Users can execute complex multi-chain operations through their chosen p.s. identity without manually switching networks or managing gas tokens.

#### Operation Flow
1. User selects a p.s. identity for the operation
2. System routes the transaction through the identity's smart contract
3. Cross-chain components handle bridging and execution
4. User receives confirmation across all involved chains

## 4. Use Cases and Applications

### 4.1 Privacy-Preserving DeFi Trading

**Anonymous Trading Identity**
A user can create a separate p.s. identity specifically for DeFi trading. This identity's address is never linked to their primary wallet, allowing for completely anonymous trading while maintaining the ability to prove asset ownership when needed.

**Professional Portfolio Management**
Investment managers can create separate identities for different clients or strategies, ensuring that trading activities remain compartmentalized and private.

### 4.2 Compartmentalized Asset Management

**Gaming Assets**
Gaming-related NFTs and tokens can be managed through a dedicated gaming identity, separate from other Web3 activities. This prevents game developers and other players from seeing the user's full financial portfolio.

**Art Collection**
NFT collectors can maintain a public art collection identity while keeping their trading activities private. This allows for reputation building in the art community without exposing financial information.

### 4.3 Enhanced Security Through Isolation

**High-Value Asset Protection**
Users can keep high-value assets in identities that rarely interact with new or unverified contracts, while maintaining more active identities for experimental DeFi activities.

**Graduated Risk Management**
Different identities can have different security policies, spending limits, and authorized contracts based on their intended use cases.

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Smart Contract Security

**Audit Strategy**
All core protocol contracts undergo comprehensive security audits by multiple independent firms. The modular architecture ensures that vulnerabilities in one component don't compromise the entire system.

**Upgrade Mechanisms**
While the core identity system is immutable, peripheral components use upgradeable proxy patterns with appropriate timelock controls to allow for security fixes and feature improvements.

### 6.2 Key Management

**Distributed Risk**
The dual-key system (p.s. keys + EOA control) ensures that compromise of either component alone cannot result in complete loss of control. Users maintain ultimate authority through their primary EOA.

**Recovery Mechanisms**
If p.s. keys are lost, users can recover control through their primary EOA. If the primary EOA is compromised, users can transfer NFT ownership to a new EOA before an attacker can gain control.

### 6.3 Privacy Protection

**Zero-Knowledge Implementation**
All privacy features use well-established ZK constructions to ensure that private information cannot be derived from public proofs.

**Data Minimization**
The protocol is designed to minimize data collection and storage. Most user data remains client-side, with only necessary cryptographic commitments stored on-chain.

## 7. Economic Model

### 7.1 Sustainable Development

**Open Source Approach**
The p.s. Protocol is released as open source software without a native token. Development is sustained through grants, partnerships, and voluntary contributions from the community.

**Fee Structure**
The protocol charges minimal fees for certain operations (identity creation, cross-chain transactions) to cover infrastructure costs. These fees are paid in the native gas tokens of the respective chains.

### 7.2 Value Accrual

**Network Effects**
Value accrues to the ecosystem through increased usage and integration. As more protocols join the verified registry and more users create identities, the platform becomes more valuable for all participants.

**Developer Ecosystem**
dApps benefit from simplified user onboarding and enhanced privacy features, while users benefit from a unified experience across all integrated protocols.
